3.23.2020 three states: fully closed, partially open, fully open.

If we get to define the partially open/mid state, then only leave it open enough to see the first heading.","4.13.2020 We discussed eliminating the use of the drawer, and adding the sources as a textBlock beneath the Statement. We tossed around the idea of using a different background color for the sources to differentiate the two. 

NJ concerns are: what changes to the system do we have to make to make the transition? The way sources are currently organized and linked to statements in Airtable is convenient, would we have to make changes?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Original Issue 3.23.2020: Keep the evidence drawer peek-a-boo open so that it’s obvious the drawer is there

The drawer is currently set up so that if I close the drawer all the way on screen 2/15, the drawer remains closed on all future screens. 

We propose that if the user closes the drawer on screen 2/15, and swipes to screen 3/15, that the drawer re-open so it is obvious to that there is more in the drawer for screen 3/15.

We did not determine if the drawer should remain closed if she reaches the end of the chat and chooses to swipe backwards. I propose that if she swipes backwards in a chat to go to a previous statement, and she closed the drawer on the statement, then the drawer remains closed. Similarly, if she leaves it open on a statement, then we leave the drawer open when she swipes back to that statement.",,,,,,
