The goal of the Pitch Stats is to help the user ensure that anytime she runs into her boss or another networking prospect, the user has something new to say about what she is doing in her career. 

CARD FUNCTIONALITY:
- System scans all of a users pitches. 
- When there are multiple pitches in the Pitch Section List, the system uses the most recent pitch. 
    - The system looks at the Practice Dates to evaluate most recent. If there are no practice dates, then use the create date of the Pitch. 
- From the card, she can click through to the View Pitch Entry for the respective pitch. 
- The Pitches stay lit up in color when they are Fresh-- meaning that the pitch create date or the pitch practice date are within the window of time the user sets for the Pitch Freshness Period
    - Ex: A user sets a 1 month Pitch Freshness Period in the settings chat. She enters her pitch and practices it on 6/4/2020. On 7/4/2020, her pitch would dim to vellum or grey because it is outside of the Pitch Freshness Period the user set.

CARD DESIGN:
The Pitch stats card is shown in the attached picture. A picture from Rent the Runway is also attached for reference as to what we are going for. 

The title of the card is Pitch Prepped.

We'd like four square boxes with white space between each box. On each box we want the pitch type name: Elevator in top left, Networking in top right, Goal in bottom left, Social in bottom right. 

The boxes will be Vellum color (#f8f6ea) when they are empty (meaning there is no pitch for that type entered in the Pitch entries), and it will turn the green color used for the Low Satisfaction on the Satisfaction Stats card when there is a pitch for the pitch type. 

LATER FUNCTIONALITY:
For the user that is practicing her pitch and actively using a pitch that falls outside the Pitch Freshness Period, we would ask her ""Is this Pitch still Fresh?"" and she could select whether she wants to keep the current pitch as Fresh or if she wants to add a new fresh pitch.
